## Introduction

Awesome question ‚Äî method receivers in Go (value vs pointer) are one of those things that look simple but have deep implications on behavior, especially in interfaces and method sets.

## What is a Method Receiver?

In Go, methods are functions that are bound to a type. <br>

```
func (r ReceiverType) MethodName() { ... }        // Value receiver
func (r *ReceiverType) MethodName() { ... }       // Pointer receiver

```

### üîç Key Behavior

#### 1. Modifying Struct Fields

```
type Counter struct {
    Count int
}

func (c Counter) IncrementValue() {
    c.Count++
}

func (c *Counter) IncrementPointer() {
    c.Count++
}

```

```
func main() {
    c := Counter{}
    c.IncrementValue()   // No effect
    fmt.Println(c.Count) // 0

    c.IncrementPointer() // Modifies original
    fmt.Println(c.Count) // 1
}

```

#### 2. Method Set Rules

```
type Person struct{}

func (Person) Hello()       {}  // Value receiver
func (*Person) Wave()       {}  // Pointer receiver

var v Person
var p *Person

v.Hello()   // ‚úÖ OK
v.Wave()    // ‚ùå ERROR: cannot call pointer receiver on value

p.Hello()   // ‚úÖ OK (Go auto-dereferences)
p.Wave()    // ‚úÖ OK

```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Go doesn't auto-reference a value to call a pointer receiver, but does auto-dereference a pointer to call a value receiver.

## üìå When to Use What?

### Use pointer receiver when:

- You need to modify the receiver.
- Your struct is large (avoid copying).
- You're working with interfaces (if method has pointer receiver, value won‚Äôt satisfy it).

### Use value receiver when:

- The method does not modify the receiver.
- Your struct is small (copying is cheap).
- You want consistency with built-in types (like time.Time uses value receivers).

## üß† Bonus: Interface Gotcha

```
type Speaker interface {
    Speak()
}

type Dog struct{}

func (d Dog) Speak() {
    fmt.Println("Woof")
}

func main() {
    var d Dog
    var p *Dog

    var s Speaker = d  // ‚úÖ Works
    s.Speak()

    var s2 Speaker = p // ‚úÖ Works (pointer method exists)
    s2.Speak()
}

```

But if Speak() was defined on \*Dog, then:

```
func (d *Dog) Speak() { ... }

var s Speaker = d  // ‚ùå ERROR: Dog does not implement Speaker (missing *Dog.Speak)

```
