/*
An interface type is defined as a set of method signatures.

A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.

------------------------------------------------
A type implements an interface by implementing its methods. There is no explicit declaration of intent, no "implements" keyword.

Implicit interfaces decouple the definition of an interface from its implementation, which could then appear in any package without prearrangement.

We can understand Interface as a Container with dynamic-type && dynamic-size
First time, when you declare it, value is `nil`, at this time, You cannot access to property of interface
You need assign it then access


---------------------------------------------------
If the concrete value inside the interface itself is nil, the method will be called with a nil receiver.

In some languages this would trigger a null pointer exception, but in Go it is common to write methods that gracefully handle being called with a nil receiver (as with the method M in this example.)

Note that an interface value that holds a nil concrete value is itself non-nil.

-----------------------------------------------------

A nil interface value holds neither value nor concrete type.

Calling a method on a nil interface is a run-time error because there is no type inside the interface tuple to indicate which concrete method to call.
